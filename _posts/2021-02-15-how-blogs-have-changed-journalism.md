title: How Blogs Have Changed Journalism
---

The internet gave everyone a voice and with that came a lot of "user written media", written media could now be done by anybody, not necessarily professionals, and reach millions of people.
It changed journalism and written media in general, blogs are free from the constraints of journalism and allows writers to break news as soon as it occurs, anyone can, for good or bad, now publicize anything at any time.

The Modern Public Square
====
Jay Rosen, New York University journalism professor, [writes](http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2004/04/16/con_prelude.html), “Bloggers are speakers and writers of their own invention, at large in the public square. They’re participating in the great game of influence called public opinion.”
Despite that many old-school journalists don't believe blogging to be journalism you can't deny the effect it has had on the craft. As mentioned earlier, blogs are without the constraints of journalism, which means they don't have support their work with credible sources and they can publish at any time making them increasingly competetive with traditional written media like newspapers who publish once a day at max.
An example of this is the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky scandal which published on [The Drudge Report](http://www.drudgereportarchives.com/data/2002/01/17/20020117_175502_ml.htm), an online news website, in 1998 before any major print publication.
With declining numbers of readers and the increasing competetion from online written media, most if not all traditional newspapers now have a online newspaper. Some newspapers are even only online. 

The internet and blogging also opened its doors to amateur writers and would-be journalists, giving everyone a free platform to publish their writings. Some people turn that into legitimate jobs, different modern social media platforms has made that even more available by pairing these (mostly) amateur content creators with ads to make money.

Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and other social media
====
A lot of people nowadays get most of their news from pages and people they follow/like on different social media like Twitter and Facebook. News has become instant. Many journalists also utilize social media, especially Twitter, commenting news as it happens (mostly for big events, like Mark Zuckerbergs congressional hearing) live blogging what they find interesting or think has the interest of the public.
Videos that become news stories are posted on several sites before being reported on and sometimes streamed live as they happen, with everyone having a smartphone a lot of breaking news are being filmed and posted online by general people before a journalist and camera crew appear at the site.

I would also like to point out how meta it is to write a blog about how blogs have changed written media.
