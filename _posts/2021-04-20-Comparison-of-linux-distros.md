title: Comparison of Pop!_OS & Red Hat
---

Pick two distributions of Linux and write a short comparison (origins, target groups, development/licensing/business models, leadership/community/supporters, software choices etc). 

**What is Pop!OS?:**
Pop!OS is a free and Open Source Linux distribution based upon Ubuntu featuring a custom GNOME desktop and is developed by an american Linux computer manufacturer, System76. As described on their website this is a distribution for scientists, engineers, creators, makers, etc. It is designed for people who need to get things done on a technical level. But I can't really see any reason why it shouldn't also be used for everyday use for normal people that wants to use Linux.
As Pop!OS is based on Ubuntu and uses APT & Flatpack package management which means it runs most software and it's easy to install, update and remove software. Like many other Linux distros it utilizes Open Source software like LibreOffice etc.

Like many other Linux distros Pop!OS has it's own forums/community and also a reddit community although these people mostly just talk about the distro and don't actively contribute to it. Also none of these communities are official.

Pop!OS is in a very interesting place as it is developed by a Linux computer manufacturer, I would say you can draw references to Apple/MAC as they're not only are they making the hardware but also the software designed for their machines, when these two can be designed in tandem it will undoubtedly make for a more seamless and clean interaction between the two.


**What is Red Hat?:**
Redhat Linux was a commercial Linux distribution created in May 1995. It was discontinued in 2003 in favor of Red Hat Enterprise Linux(RHEL) for enterprise environments. A community-supported project called Fedora is also developed(by Fedora project) and sponsored by Red Hat, which is a free-of-cost- alternative for home use.
RHEL was initially released in 2000 and uses strict trademark rules to restrict re-distribution of their official supported version but it's still possible to build derivatives by stripping away non-free components (fx. CentOS). Red Hats target group is clearly other businesses and not general users.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion you should use Pop!OS as a general user and RHEL if you're a company.
