Inspired by people like [Daniel Miessler](https://danielmiessler.com/) and several guides(<https://danielmiessler.com/blog/build-successful-infosec-career/>, <https://www.cyberstudents.org/blog-post/why-cybersecurity-students-should-blog-and-how-to-get-one-started/>) which suggest you create a website/blog I finally decided to make one myself after a friend of mine showed me Jekyll. I was sold. It provides me with all my needs for a website/blog while being very easily accessible.


Why I've created this website/blog
======
Writing about your projects and explaining what you've learned to others is the best way to get the deepest understanding of the subject you're learning(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching>). And publicly talking about and committing to your goals will put pressure on yourself to actually finish your projects.
Most of the stuff I will start posting will, to many, be simple as I'm a fairly new student. I hope that in the future the website will be a good resource and my contribution to the IT community.


What am I gonna use it for?
======
I will use it to better myself, mostly in subjects about computer science and cyber security, collect and share resources and things I find interesting as well as my opinions about a wide array of topics. The website is gonna start out as my own little database of current projects, things I've done and resources I utilize(d).
Hopefully at some point it will become helpful and useful for others as well.
